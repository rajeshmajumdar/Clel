Well it's nothing serious, I always wanted to learn how a programming language is created. So it's just a pet project for me to learn how a compiler is implemented although it's a top level language built on C, so I still have to a lot to learn when it comes to machine codes.

Next I wanna build a compiler for C, fingers crossed.
